# pySWC
Functions used for the manipulation of swc files

Swc files are commonly used to represent neurons. They can be used for 
morphological analysis and to create biophysically realistic computational models.
This Python class can be used to process the file. 
The test file shows how to implement the class.

Only dependency is numpy

Future directions include adding data analysis methods and more manipulation functions
